# Hi there 👋
## I am Aditya Dharap, a UW-Madison freshman interested in programming projects.
### Projects I have worked on:
  - A prototype web application which allows users to find detailed recycling information on <u>**any**</u> object simply by clicking a picture. This was done using Flask, OpenAI API, firebase, javascript and object detection.
  - An IBDP grade management system using the python programming language.
  - An email spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm, tested on the Enron Spam Dataset.
  - A pose estimation and classification algorithm using tensorflow's posenet as part of my workplace inclusivity project featured at the IB Festival of Hope.

Currently working on some simulations and creating some easy to use functions which combines features from the OpenCV library and builds functionality.
